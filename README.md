Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my first attempt on writing code on HTML5 and CSS and my first-time using Git. My webpage is very simple and has four (4) HTML files containing a main page, a very short info about me (for home-work purpose only), a hobby list and some of my experience as an employee.
